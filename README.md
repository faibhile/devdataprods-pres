OK I'm having difficulty publishing the presentation to github, it says my github page doesn't exist when it does.
So, this is the index.Rmd file from which the slide show is created. Apologies for the inconvenience (or you could take a look at the index.Rmd file to see the slides).

## Read-And-Delete

The square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Yay!

## Slide 2

... so says Mr. Pythagoras of Greek fame

---

## Slide 3

Here's some R code to do that

```{r}
hypotenuse  <- ((adjacent^2) + (opposite^2))^0.5
````

---

## Slide 4

Knowing the length of the opposite and the adjacent we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse

The End and thanks for watching!
